  Hi, my name's Alban and I'm a software developer and data analyst. My main role is to develop and maintain client side applications (local and web apps) used for collecting data. I am also responsible for all the documentation, support and training provided to the various colleagues, external stackeholders and data providers. I started my career as software developer since 2017 just after my graduation in computer science.

  What I like the most is: develop software and try to achive interesting goals, travel and discover new cultures as well as being able to talk with animals in a comprehensible language (who wants to help me?).
